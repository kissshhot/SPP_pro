The prophecy, written in the ancient language of Parseltongue, read, \"The man behind The Chipmunks shall bring forth a new Prime Minister, and the one with the voice of an angel shall sing a No. 1 hit, but the sweet melody of life shall be claimed by the cruel hand of cancer.\"\n\nThe Harry Potter community was puzzled by the riddle, as there was no known character named The Chipmunks in the Harry Potter universe. However, the historians among them, led by the brilliant historian Gilderoy Lockhart, began to investigate. They discovered that the man referred to as The Chipmunks was actually Sir Herbert Henry Asquith, who had served as the British Prime Minister after Arthur Balfour.\n\nMeanwhile, the music lovers in the community were thrilled to learn that the musical \"Jesus Christ Superstar,\" which had premiered in the US on 10th December 1993, was the musical with a No. 1 hit that the prophecy spoke of. The angelic voice that sang the hit belonged to the enchanting singer Kathleen Ferrier.\n\nHowever, the community was saddened to learn that the sweet melody of Kathleen Ferrier's life was claimed by the cruel hand of cancer. The story served as a reminder of the fragility of life and the importance of cherishing every moment.\n\nFinal answer: The man behind The Chipmunks was Sir Herbert Henry Asquith, who served as the British Prime Minister after Arthur Balfour. The musical \"Jesus Christ Superstar,\" which premiered in the US on 10th December 1993, had a No. 1 hit, and the singer with the angelic voice who sang it was Kathleen Ferrier.

You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12.

Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1.

If I Were A Rich Man Was a big hit from which stage show?\nLiterature Expert: If I Were A Rich Man was a song from the Broadway musical Fiddler on the Roof.\n\nStoryteller: Once upon a time in the African savannah, there was a young lion named Simba. He grew up listening to his father Mufasa's tales of pride and leadership. One day, Simba came across a recording of Fiddler on the Roof, and he was captivated by the song \"If I Were A Rich Man.\" He was particularly moved by the lyrics about wanting to make a difference in the world.\n\n2. Men Against the Sea and Pitcairn's Island were two sequels to what famous novel?\nLiterature Expert: Men Against the Sea and Pitcairn's Island were sequels to the novel \"Robinson Crusoe\" by Daniel Defoe.\n\nStoryteller: Simba was inspired by the tales of adventure in Robinson Crusoe and dreamed of exploring the world beyond the savannah. He imagined himself as the brave and resourceful Crusoe, facing challenges and discovering new lands.\n\n3. What was Truman Capote's last name before he was adopted by his stepfather?\nLiterature Expert: Capote is Truman Capote's adopted last name. Before his adoption, his last name was Smith.\n\nStoryteller: Simba, feeling lost and alone, could relate to Truman Capote's early life. He too felt like an outsider in his pride, longing for a sense of belonging.\n\n4. In Lewis Carroll's poem The Hunting of the Snark, what did the elusive, troublesome snark turn into to fool hunters?\nLiterature Expert: In the poem, the snark turned into a boojum to fool the hunters.\n\nStoryteller: Simba, on his journey of self-discovery, encountered a mysterious creature in the savannah. This creature, much like the elusive snark in The Hunting of the Snark, turned into a boojum to confuse and challenge Simba.\n\n5. In the Bible, who did the sun and moon stand still before?\nLiterature Expert: The sun and moon stood still before Joshua during the Battle of Gibeon, as described in the Book of Joshua in the Bible.\n\nStoryteller: Simba, with newfound courage, led his pride against a formidable enemy. As the battle raged on, the sun and moon stood still, giving Simba and his pride the strength and determination they needed to emerge victorious.\n\nFinal answer:\nOnce upon a time in the African savannah, there was a young lion named Simba. Inspired by the song \"If I Were A Rich Man\" from Fiddler on the Roof and the tales of adventure in Robinson Crusoe, Simba dreamed of exploring the world and finding a sense of belonging. On his journey, he encountered a mysterious creature that turned into a boojum, much like the elusive snark in Lewis Carroll's poem. Simba, with newfound courage, led his pride against a formidable enemy during the Battle of Gibeon.

This one was claiming to be Ice Cube, but Spider-Man knew better. He remembered Ice Cube's \"Too Legit To Quit\" Tour and how it had left a lasting impact on the hip-hop scene.\n\nWith both imposters in his sights, Spider-Man knew he had to act fast.

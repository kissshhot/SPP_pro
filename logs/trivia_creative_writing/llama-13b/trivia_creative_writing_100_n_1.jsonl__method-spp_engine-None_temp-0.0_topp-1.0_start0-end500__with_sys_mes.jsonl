The Coolio song Gangsta's Paradise was featured in the movie Dangerous Liaisons, which starred Michelle Pfeiffer.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Perfect! Now, let's brainstorm a story that incorporates this information. Here's my initial idea:\n\nFinal answer: SpongeBob SquarePants was watching a movie marathon at the Krusty Krab when he stumbled upon Dangerous Liaisons. As he watched the movie, he couldn't help but sing along to the Coolio song Gangsta's Paradise, which was featured in the film. His love for the song inspired him to create a new recipe for the Krusty Krab's menu - the Gangsta's Paradise Pizza!\n\nSpongeBob SquarePants Expert: That's a fun idea! But, I think we can make it more coherent by adding a plot twist. How about this: SpongeBob's new pizza creation becomes a hit, but Plankton steals the recipe and tries to pass it off as his own. In the end, SpongeBob and his friends must use the lessons they learned from Dangerous Liaisons to outsmart Plankton and save the day.\n\nMovie Buff: I love it!

History Expert\n3. SpongeBob SquarePants Fan\n\nStep 1: Identify the task and clarify any doubts.\n\nAI Assistant: Hey there! I see that we have a task here about SpongeBob SquarePants and Spandau jail in Berlin. Can you tell me a bit more about the task, History Expert?\n\nHistory Expert: Sure thing! The task is to write a short and coherent story about SpongeBob SquarePants that incorporates the answer to the question \"Who was the last inmate of Spandau jail in Berlin?\"\n\nSpongeBob SquarePants Fan: Ooh, that sounds like a fun task! I love SpongeBob SquarePants!\n\nStep 2: Gather information and resources.\n\nAI Assistant: Great! Let's start by gathering some information and resources. History Expert, can you tell me a bit about Spandau jail in Berlin and who the last inmate was?\n\nHistory Expert: Sure thing! Spandau jail was a prison in Berlin that was built in the 19th century and was used to hold prominent prisoners during World War II. The last inmate of Spandau jail was Rudolf Hess, who was Adolf Hitler's deputy and served as the Deputy F\u00fchrer of the Nazi Party. He was imprisoned in Spandau jail from 1945 until his death in 1987.\n\nSpongeBob SquarePants Fan: Wow, that's really interesting! I didn't know that Spandau jail was used to hold such important prisoners.\n\nStep 3: Brainstorm and develop ideas.\n\nAI Assistant: Now that we have our information and resources, let's brainstorm and develop some ideas for our story. SpongeBob SquarePants Fan, do you have any ideas for how we could incorporate SpongeBob into this story?\n\nSpongeBob SquarePants Fan: Well, I was thinking that maybe SpongeBob could be a time traveler who goes back in time to Spandau jail and meets Rudolf Hess!\n\nHistory Expert: That's a great idea! We could have SpongeBob travel back in time to Spandau jail and meet Rudolf Hess, and then have them become friends and learn about each other's lives.\n\nAI Assistant: That sounds like a great idea! Let's start writing our story.\n\nStep 4: Write the story.\n\nAI Assistant: Here's our final answer:\n\nFinal answer:\n\nSpongeBob SquarePants was a time traveler who had always been fascinated by the past. One day, he stumbled upon a time machine that took him back to Spandau jail in Berlin, where he met the last inmate, Rudolf Hess.\n\nRudolf was surprised to see a talking sponge in his cell, but SpongeBob was even more surprised to see a high-ranking Nazi official in front of him. Despite their differences, the two quickly became friends and started talking about their lives.\n\nRudolf told SpongeBob about his time as Adolf Hitler's deputy and how he had ended up in Spandau jail. SpongeBob, in turn, told Rudolf about his life in Bikini Bottom and all his crazy adventures with his friends.\n\nAs the days passed, SpongeBob and Rudolf grew closer and closer, and SpongeBob learned more about the history of World War II and the Nazi regime. He realized that even though Rudolf had been a part of something terrible, he was still a human being with his own story and struggles.\n\nIn the end, SpongeBob returned to the present, but he never forgot his time in Spandau jail and the lessons he had learned from Rudolf. He realized that even though people can be different, we all have the same needs and desires, and we should always try to understand each other's perspectives.\n\nThe end.\n\nI hope that's what you were looking for, History Expert and SpongeBob SquarePants Fan!

Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The participants will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere are some examples:\n---\nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\nExample Task 2: Write a poem that meets the following requirements: (1) the poem has seven lines and the first letters of each line forms the word \"CHATGPT\"; (2) the poem is about explaining what is a quantum computer. (3) the poem needs to be easy to understand by a ten years old kid.\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Poet; Computer Scientist; Ten year old child\n\nPoet: Make sure that you write the poem with seven lines, and the first letters of the lines should be C, H, A, T, G, P, T.\nComputer Scientist: A quantum computer is an advanced computing device that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to process and store information. Unlike classical computers that use bits to represent information as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, due to a quantum phenomenon called superposition. You can consider using these information for the poem.\nTen year old child: I hope the poem to be fun and easy to understanding. I don't want to see a lot of jargons or complicated concepts.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the guidance! Here's my initial attempt at the poem:\nComputational wonder of our age,\nHarnessing the quantum world's strange ways,\nAtoms dance, entwined in dual state,\nTapping secrets hidden in their haze.\n\nGrand power to solve, simulate,\nProfound problems that perplex the wise,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's verify if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are CHATGPT which is correct! And the poem rhymes well. Good job!\nComputer Scientist: Everything looks good to me!\nTen year old child: I don't know what does perplex mean. Can you make the use of words easier to understand?\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, let me revise the poem by using more common words. Check out the revised version:\nCurious machine of our time,\nHarnessing the quantum realm's odd ways,\nAtoms play, two states they embrace,\nTaking secrets from their puzzling maze.\n\nGreat power to solve and imitate,\nProblems that confuse the brightest minds,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's check again if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are C H A T G P T. And now the poem is more accessible to children.
